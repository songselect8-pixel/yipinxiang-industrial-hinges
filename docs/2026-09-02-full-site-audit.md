# Final Full-Site Audit

**Audit date:** 2026-09-04  
**Audited preview:** `http://127.0.0.1:3100`  
**Result:** The approved site, including the Resources system, passes the local production-preview audit. It is intentionally **not ready for public production traffic** until the launch blockers below are completed.

No approved page was redesigned. The final Resources pass made one route-scoped correction: the duplicate desktop table of contents inside the article reading column is now hidden, leaving the approved sidebar TOC on desktop and the collapsible TOC on smaller screens.

## Scope

The locked release contains 25 public content routes:

- Homepage
- Products center
- Ten product-family detail pages
- Applications
- Custom Hinges
- Manufacturing
- Quality Control
- About Us
- Contact / RFQ
- Resources center
- Six published Resources article routes

The existing 18-route baseline and the final seven-route Resources audit cover 100 page-and-viewport combinations across 1440, 1024, 768 and 390px. `/feed.xml` and `/sitemap.xml` were checked separately as publishing endpoints.

## Passed checks

- All 25 public content routes return HTTP 200 from the production preview.
- All six Resources cards link to a real `/resources/[slug]` article. There are no placeholder article routes, empty templates, `href="#"` links or date-based article URLs.
- Every published article has one H1, breadcrumb, category, introduction, publication date, generated table of contents, structured H2/H3 content, key takeaways, publisher, relevant related modules and an RFQ path.
- The six article titles and meta descriptions are unique. Every article emits the correct route pathname in its canonical and Open Graph URL, `og:type=article`, descriptive image metadata, `BlogPosting` structured data and `BreadcrumbList` structured data.
- `Pinghu Yipinxiang Machinery Technology Co., Ltd.` is the article publisher. No individual author credentials were invented.
- Article product tables read from the existing verified product data layer. Inline catalog examples retain their original model names, symbols, values, decimal precision and source boundaries.
- Related Products, Related Applications and Related Resources use explicit mappings. Each article shows two to four relevant guides, and the related-guide combinations vary by article.
- Draft and noindex records are filtered from the hub, visible categories, related guides, static parameters, RSS and sitemap publishing paths.
- The Resources header entry fits at 1440px. At 1024, 768 and 390px the mobile menu opens, exposes Resources, marks it as current and causes no horizontal overflow.
- Article reading width, long headings, images, drawings, table overflow regions, related cards and mobile spacing remain contained at all four audited widths.
- No browser console errors, page errors, required-resource failures, broken images, missing TOC anchors, missing same-page fragments or unexpected page-level horizontal overflow were detected in the final 28 Resources page-and-viewport checks.
- Thirty-one unique internal destinations reached from Resources return successful HTTP responses.
- `/feed.xml` returns six published items. The sitemap publishing registry contains the Resources hub plus all six published article routes and no draft or test article records.
- All 109 unique file paths recorded across the nine lock manifests match their approved hashes after the scoped TOC correction was recorded.

## Blocking before production

1. **CRITICAL BEFORE PRODUCTION:** Connect the RFQ form to a real server-side delivery system and perform a real submission test to the configured inquiry recipient.
2. Set `SITE_URL` to the confirmed final HTTPS origin. Recheck every canonical, Open Graph URL, `BlogPosting.mainEntityOfPage`, breadcrumb item and RSS URL on that origin.
3. Verify that the deployed sitemap contains `/resources` and exactly the six approved published article routes, contains no drafts or test records, and contains no `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` URLs. The final production domain remains unconfirmed, so the local preview origin must not be deployed as sitemap data.
4. Replace the preview search policy. The current pages are `noindex, nofollow` and `robots.txt` disallows the whole site. Enable indexing only after the production domain, content and RFQ delivery are ready.
5. Publish the final inquiry privacy information and implement server-side validation, abuse protection, secure file handling, retention rules and operational monitoring.
6. Configure and verify deployment security headers. The local preview does not currently emit CSP, MIME sniffing protection, framing restrictions, Referrer Policy, Permissions Policy or HSTS. Enable HSTS only after the final HTTPS deployment is correct.

The complete blocking and future Resources publishing workflow is maintained in `docs/pre-launch-checklist.md` and `docs/resources-publishing-guide.md`.

## Non-blocking implementation advisories

The current approved UI passes its functional and accessibility-oriented browser checks. A later, explicitly approved maintenance pass may also consider:

- warning about unsaved RFQ entries before leaving a page after a buyer has begun a long inquiry;
- disabling spellcheck on business-email fields;
- using consistent ellipsis treatment in placeholder copy;
- preventing translation of brand-name tokens where machine translation could alter them.

These items do not justify changing locked pages during this audit.

## Final command verification

- `npm test`: **73 passed, 0 failed**.
- `npm run typecheck`: **passed** with no TypeScript errors.
- `npm run build`: **passed**; Next.js generated all 31 static/SSG build outputs, including the Resources hub and six article pages.
- Final production preview: restarted from the successful build at `http://127.0.0.1:3100`; the Resources hub, six article routes, feed and sitemap all returned HTTP 200.
